# grunt-once

> Open HTML files with PhantomJS and renders their DOM into a new file when `window.isRenderable` is set to `true`.

## Usage

### The "once" task
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `once` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  once: {
    your_target: {
      src: 'your.html',
      dest: 'build/your.html'
    },
  },
});
```

### Your html
grunt-once will only render the page when the property `window.isRenderable` is set to `true`.
Introduce this variable in your script and make sure to set it to `true` when the renderable DOM changes are done.

```js
function manipulateDOM() {
	document.createElement( ... );
	
	{{your code}}

	window.isRenderable = true;
}

window.onload = manipulateDOM;
```
